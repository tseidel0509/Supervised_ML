## Use Case: Predict Hotel Booking Cancellations

### Problem Description:

Hotel cancellations pose a challenge in the hospitality business. Clients expect to be able to enjoy the advertised amenities. Ensuring everything runs smoothly requires careful planning and is always affected by the number of guests. Hence cancelled bookings lead to revenue loss and inefficiencies in resource allocation. A variety of factors may lead to a cancellation.

### Solution

Supervised machine learning, could help mitigate the issues resulting from cancellations that seem to be happening unexpectedly. A classification model can be trained using historical booking data in order to predict whether or not a combination of features is likely to lead to a cancellation. Specifically, the goal is to predict the number of cancellations for a sufficiently sized dataset.

## Deliverables
The repository consists 2 jupyter notebooks that comprise an Exploratory Data Analysis and training/evaluation pipeline. The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mojtaba142/hotel-booking. Additional uploads include the filtered dataframe as well as the encoded data frame.
